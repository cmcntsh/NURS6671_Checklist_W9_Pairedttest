<h1 align="center">Statistical Analysis/Critique Steps</h1>

Hopefully, the statistics you calculate are more than just a collection of random facts about the data you have. Most of the time, individuals and organizations seek to answer a question or solve a problem using statistical data. As such, the statistics you calculate should be part of the supporting evidence of a well-crafted argument (Booth et al., 2016). Validity is an overarching concern of science and refers to the level of truth we ascribe to inferences (Shadish et al., 2002). This checklist aims to help you gather information relevant to establishing the validity of the inferences you seek to make with the statistics you calculate. The answers you provide to the prompts in this checklist are the logical foundation upon which any arguments you desire to make with the results of your analyses rest. Ensuring the integrity of your data and analyses is part of ethical statistical practice (American Statistical Association, 2022). Background information should not be overlooked when conducting and interpreting statistical analyses. It’s never a bad idea to consult a statistician during the planning stages of a study or analysis to ensure the data collection and analysis plan is sound (Berman & Gullion, 2007). This checklist will also help you gather and prepare the information needed to work with a statistician or critique the work of others.

What is the source of the data you’ve gathered? Is the mechanism by which you’ve collected your data subject to bias? The questions in this section are geared toward data collected as part of a study, but the same concepts apply when analyzing data from an existing data source. If you are extracting data from an existing data source, you might consider by what mechanisms data were collected and entered into that data source and what query was used to extract the data from the data source. Are the data collection and entry methods subject to bias? Is the wording of the query sound, or are there potential errors or omissions which might lead to some of the relevant data being excluded from the dataset used for analysis?

    <td>Test selection & Power analysis: Before a statistical test can be conducted, the correct statistical test must first be selected. The test selected depends mainly on the levels of measurement of the data you have available and the characteristics of those data. You may also need to meet certain thresholds for the amount of data you have to be able to conduct a meaningful test. (Determining the amount of data needed is often accomplished by conducting a power analysis.) What statistical test(s) will be conducted? Which variable(s) will be used in those test(s)?
